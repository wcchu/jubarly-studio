                In recent years, both human and veterinary medical care have taken a shift towards a more integrative
                approach. What that means is taking a more comprehensive approach to health care that combines the best
                of conventional medicine and complementary and alternative therapies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Western medicine and nontraditional medicine are not mutually exclusive, and the integration of these
                practices is often extremely beneficial. The goals of both are the same: healing, maintaining a good
                quality of life for our patients, and disease prevention.
            </p>

                Acupuncture is one of the commonly used non-conventional treatments for pets that is safe and effective.
                It is a modality that is often offered in Traditional Chinese Veterinary Medicine (TCVM) that has a very
                broad range of applications and has recently gained significant popularity as a sole or adjunct
                treatment in veterinary medicine. The mechanism of acupuncture is not fully understood at this time, but
                numerous current studies have provided strong evidence of at least some explanation of the effectiveness
                of the treatment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Acupuncture is performed by inserting very thin sterile needles in the skin mostly along the 14 major
                channels that carry energy throughout the body, which can provide pain relief, stimulate the nervous and
                immune systems, decrease fever, regulate the GI and circulatory systems, and address neurological and
                musculoskeletal disorders.
