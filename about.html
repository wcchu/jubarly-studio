            <p>Wei-Chun Chu (he/him) is a visual artist working and living in
                Berlin.</p>

            <p>Chu was born in Taipei, Taiwan. He developed a great interest in
                both art and science since childhood. At
                age of 18 he went to study physics at National Taiwan
                University. An year later he joined the
                university&rsquo;s Fine Art Club and study oil painting under
                several tutors, including celebrity
                painter and songwriter <a href="https://w.wiki/i6g">Yu-Wei
                    Hsieh</a> and Chang-Lun Lin of the Rembrandt
                Art Studio in Taipei. After finishing the undergraduate program,
                Chu took the compulsory military
                service in Taiwan&rsquo;s National Army. During this time he
                developed an enthusiasm in photography and
                trained his eyes and skills to make landscape and journalistic
                photographs.</p>

            <p>After the military service, Chu was admitted in the doctorate
                program at Georgia State University in the
                United States, and subsequently earned the PhD degree in physics
                in 2009. From 2005 to 2008 he was a
                guitarist in the Atlanta-based rock band Dark Seeds,
                electro-rock act Sound Detour (<a
                    href="https://soundcloud.com/sounddetour">SoundCloud</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SoundDetour">YouTube</a>),
                and electro-pop project Phosphor
                Production. This role and the close contact with other musicians
                brought a strong influence of pop
                culture and fantasy/sci-fi content to his art works. In late
                2009 he moved to Kansas State University as
                a research associate to further himself in academia.</p>

            <p>In 2013, Chu moved from Kansas to Erlangen in Southern Germany to
                work in ultrafast and fiber optics at
                the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light. He worked in
                the optics lab and was inspired by many
                fascinating light effects shown in microscopic cameras and
                rendered images, which were reflected in his
                abstract paintings. In 2016 he moved to Berlin and has been
                living there ever since. His focus is oil
                painting, while he keeps experimenting with print-making,
                watercolor, ink drawing, and digital art. He
                also works as a data scientist at <a
                    href="https://www.fitanalytics.com/">Fit Analytics GmbH</a>,
                a sizing solution provider for online fashion shops.</p>
