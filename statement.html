        <h1>Artist Statement</h1>

        <div class="content" style="text-align: center">
            <p>As a visual artist, my greatest interest is to explore different light effects such as transmission,
                reflection, diffusion etc, in both representational and non-representational settings. In the
                representational setting, the primary theme of my works is the modern life of our time, particularly in
                Europe. The aim is to capture the atmosphere and people&rsquo;s daily activities, and very importantly,
                the rapid transformation of our appearances. My secondary theme is fantasy and sci-fi. I enjoy very much
                to arrange staged scenes, build characters, and create stories around them. In non-representational
                painting, I am interested in incorporating sketching and manga techniques into oil paintings, such as
                contouring, hatching, and even the symbolic facial or emotional expressions. The goal here is to use a
                level of comic &ldquo;punctuations&rdquo; to redirect the mood of an otherwise emotionless painting.</p>

            <!-- abstractization of still life -->

            <!-- materials and media -->

            <p>Regarding the materials and the media of my works, I spend the majority of my time in oil painting, when
                at the same time adding works of watercolor, ink, gouache, printing and digital painting in my
                collection. Recently I started experimenting oil painting on unconventional materials such as plastic
                cards, glossy paper boards, and metals, which hopefully will bring another dimension of expressively to
                my works.</p>

            <!-- plan for next several months -->

            <p>In the following year, I intend to explore abstract painting with two seemingly inharmonious perspectives
                at once on the same canvas&ndash;on one hand a sense of 3D physical space using classic techniques like
                shading, highlighting, gradience, etc, on the other hand a stylistic drawing borrowed from calligraphy
                and comics. I am eager to find out whether the two perspectives can be presented cohesively in one view.
